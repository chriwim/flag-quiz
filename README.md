This is an experiment in using ChatGPT for code generation and software development. The rules are the following:
* All code is written by ChatGPT
* All changes to the code are made using natural language instructions
* The instructions for each iteration are stored in commit messages
* The maintainer manually sets up the file and folder structure of the project based on ChatGPT's instructions
* The maintainer can add files that are outside the generation capabilities of ChatGPT (e.g. favicons)
